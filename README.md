## Tools
- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org) - NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Machine Learning in Python
- [Tushare](http://tushare.org/) -TuShare is a free, open source Python financial data interface package. With the Tushare,  you can easily get the public data of the Chinese stock market. It can provide fast, clean, and a variety of convenient analysis data for financial analysts. It has greatly reduced the workload, so financial analysts could focus more on the strategy and model research and implementation. 
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - An open-source software library for Machine Intelligence
- [Keras](https://keras.io/) - Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of either [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), [CNTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/cntk) or [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano). It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. *Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.*
- [CNTK](https://cntk.ai/) - The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit—previously known as CNTK—empowers you to harness the intelligence within massive datasets through deep learning by providing uncompromised scaling, speed, and accuracy with commercial-grade quality and compatibility with the programming languages and algorithms you already use. 
- [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano) - Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. It can use GPUs and perform efficient symbolic differentiation.
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) - Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
- [jieba](https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba/) - "Jieba" (Chinese for "to stutter") Chinese text segmentation: built to be the best Python Chinese word segmentation module.
- [Quantecon](https://quantecon.org/) - QuantEcon is a [NumFOCUS](http://www.numfocus.org/) fiscally sponsored project dedicated to development and documentation of modern open source computational tools for economics, econometrics, and decision making. We welcome [contributions](http://quantecon.org/get-involved/) and collaboration from the economics community and other partner organizations.
